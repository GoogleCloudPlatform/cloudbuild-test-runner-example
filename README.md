## A demo for running your tests with Cloud Container Builder

This is a demo project for showing how to run unit tests with Cloud
Container Builder.

## Test Runners

Currently we only have a test runner for phpunit at `php/test/runner`
directory. We have already built and pushed it to
`gcr.io/cloud-dpes/phpunit-test-runner`. This image is publicly
available, so feel free to use with your project.
